## About

This repository is dedicated to solving algorithmic problems on a daily basis. The main goal is to provide a platform for enthusiasts to practice problem-solving skills, explore different algorithms, and discuss solutions with the community.

## Getting Started

To get started with solving the daily algorithm challenge, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-algorithm-challenge.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd daily-algorithm-challenge
    ```

3. Each day, a new problem will be posted in the `problems/` directory. To solve the problem of the day, create a new file in the `solutions/` directory with an appropriate name, such as `Day1_solution.py`, `Day2_solution.java`, etc.

4. Implement your solution to the problem and ensure it passes all test cases.

5. Once you have finished your solution, submit a pull request to the main repository. Be sure to include a brief description of your approach and any insights gained during the problem-solving process.

6. Engage with the community! Discuss different approaches, provide feedback on solutions, and learn from others.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome and encouraged! If you have a new algorithmic problem to propose or want to improve existing solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions align with the goals and guidelines of the repository.
